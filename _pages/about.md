I am a final year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh. I am advised by [Prof Frank Keller](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/keller/). I also collaborate with [Prof Hao Tang](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/keller/) and [Prof Pasquale Minervini](http://www.neuralnoise.com/). I am part of [EdinburghNLP ](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/) group and [CDT NLP](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/natural-language-processing).



Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
