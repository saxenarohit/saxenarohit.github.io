I am a final year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh. I am advised by [Prof Frank Keller](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/keller/). I also collaborate with [Prof Pasquale Minervini](http://www.neuralnoise.com/) and [Prof Hao Tang](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/htang2/). I am affiliated with [EdinburghNLP ](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/) and [CDT NLP](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/natural-language-processing).

My research interests broadly lie in natural language understanding and multimodal learning, with a focus on long-context modeling and the intersection of vision and language.

Previously, I worked as a Researcher at [Tata Research Development and Design Center (TRDDC)][trddc-link], [TCS Research][tcs], Pune India. At TRDDC, I was part of Media and Entertainment Research group and was advised by Niranjan Pedanekar. My work there involved emotion detection in dialogues, analysing TV viewers' attention, and style transfer for advertisements.
Additionally, I interned as an Applied Scientist at Amazon Web Services (AWS) in Seattle, where I worked on mitigating hallucinations in large language models.

In my free time, I enjoy [photography][photo].
